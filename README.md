# CPUStatus
This is my first test with the QT gui.

To create the GUI of this test, I used the Design function in the QT Creator, and the remnant I wrote it in python.


<b>Installation</b> <br>
  Run this commands:

    <code>pip3 install psutil</code> <br>
    <code>pip3 install pyqt5</code>

<b>Start</b> <br>
    <code>python3 status.py
