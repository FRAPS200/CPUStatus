# CPUStatus
This is my first test with the QT gui.

To create the GUI of this test, I used the Design function in the QT Creator, and the remnant I wrote it in python.


<b>Installation</b>
  Run this commands:

<code>pip3 install psutil</code>
<code>pip3 install pyqt5</code>

<b>Start</b>
  <code>python3 status.py
